Cybercrime has grown in both frequency and complexity, posing significant challenges for authorities and affecting countless individuals worldwide. To aid in managing and prioritizing reports effectively, this project aims to develop a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model capable of classifying cybercrime incidents based on user-provided descriptions. 
This model, designed for integration with the National Cyber Crime Reporting Portal, categorizes complaints into relevant crime types and assesses sentiment to identify high-priority cases. 
By automating the categorization and sentiment analysis of reports, the system enhances the efficiency of report handling, allowing authorities to respond promptly to cases that indicate severe distress or immediate attention. 
This report outlines the modelâ€™s development process, findings from exploratory data analysis, model performance, and the implementation plan for deployment and future enhancements.
